title: Day off Sick
---
So today I was off sick. Takes a lot for me to take a day off sick. Just got no sleep the night before and was throwing up for most of the night and early morning. So after going back to bed in the early hours feeling sorry for myself I had to inform work that I was not coming in that day.

I hate telling work that I won't be attending that day. I always come over guilty and think that people are saying that I'm pulling a fast one. But this isn't the case. However, there have been a lot of people off sick recently and something has been going around. However, they took it nicely and just hoped that I didn't have what a recent ill person has had. I was hoping that as well as it was something that floors you for a week.

So I spent the rest of the day in bed with the tv on just drinking loads of water and feeling sorry for myself. Hope tomorrow I feel better. I always hate being ill as it seems as completely wasted time.

title: Hello World
---

Well hello, there the internet. Here is the first post, there are plans for much more in the future. However, if you are reading the post, then you are more than likely a developer. So you shall know that work and other commitments get in the way.  Work and other commitments outside of a blog are not problems to a software developer. They are problems that we all share.

The purpose of this blog is for me to write my thoughts, on items that I pick up and read on the sea of information out there. Also, my day to day problems as a developer, hoping that you find them useful. Also, shout out my true feelings and not worry.

In true fashion of the internet and general software engineer humour here is the first code snippet.

{% highlight java %}

public class HelloWorld
{
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
